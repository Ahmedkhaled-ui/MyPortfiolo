      Hello and welcome to my portfolio! I’m a passionate and versatile
      Front-End Developer with hands-on experience in building modern,
      responsive, and high-performance web applications using Angular and
      vanilla JavaScript. I focus on creating clean, scalable code and
      delivering smooth user experiences across all devices. I have a solid
      understanding of responsive design principles, UI/UX best practices, and
      real-world problem-solving in the front-end world. Currently, I’m
      expanding my skill set by diving into Back-End Development, with the goal
      of becoming a well-rounded Full-Stack Developer. I'm always excited to
      learn new technologies, explore performance optimizations, and stay
      up-to-date with the latest trends in web development. If you're looking
      for someone who’s detail-oriented, fast-learning, and truly enjoys turning
      ideas into functional interfaces — you’re in the right place.
    </p>
